Build a professional, modern, and animated web dashboard for monitoring IBM Quantum jobs in real-time. The dashboard should use React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion for smooth animations, and Recharts for data visualization. The design must be clean, attractive, and highly interactive.

Functional requirements:
1. Job Table:
   - Live list of jobs with columns: Job ID, Backend, Status (with animated color-coded badges), Queue Position, Submission Time, Execution Duration.
   - Rows should animate smoothly when new jobs appear or status changes.
   - Search bar and filters (by backend, status, date range, tags).
   - Actions: View results, cancel job.

2. Timeline View:
   - Gantt chart or horizontal bar chart showing job lifecycle (Queued → Running → Done).
   - Animated transitions when jobs update.

3. Session Monitor:
   - Panel showing active sessions, their jobs, and usage stats.
   - Expandable cards with smooth animations.

4. Backend Advisor:
   - Sidebar card that highlights least busy backends with animated loading state.

5. Notifications:
   - Real-time toast notifications for job completion or failure with fade-in/out animations.

6. Analytics Section:
   - Charts for aggregate stats (jobs by status, historical job counts, average runtime trends).
   - Use Recharts with animated transitions.

7. UI/UX:
   - Responsive grid layout.
   - Smooth hover effects and transitions for cards.
   - Animated refresh button and auto-polling indicator.
   - Professional dark/light theme toggle.

Tech stack:
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Styling: TailwindCSS
- Animations: Framer Motion
- Charts: Recharts
- State management: React Query (for API polling and caching)
- API: IBM Quantum REST API or Qiskit Runtime endpoints

Deliverables:
- React component code for the dashboard.
- Example mock data for jobs and sessions (to test UI).
- Clean, modular, production-ready code with comments.

Make sure the final dashboard looks visually appealing with modern design, smooth animations, and professional polish, not just basic tables.
